h1(#usaidwat). usaidwat

Are you a Redditor? Do you use Ruby? Do you want to view the subreddits in which a particular user commonly posts? If you answered "yes" to all three of these questions, then *usaidwat* is the gem for you!

h2(#install). Installation

*usaidwat* can be installed via RubyGems:

bc. $ gem install usaidwat

h2(#usage). Usage

A @usaidwat@ binary is installed with the gem. @usaidwat@ will analyze a user's last 100 comments and provide statistics.

To list a Redditor's comments, use the @log@ subcommand:

bc. $ usaidwat log mipadi

To list a count of subreddits in which a user has posted, use the @tally@
subcommand:

bc. $ usaidwat tally mipadi

You will see output like the following:

bc. apple              6
AskReddit         61
battlefield3       2
books              2
django             1
Games              1
nyc                1
personalfinance    1
photography        1
programming       20
redditcasual       1
wikipedia          1
worldnews          2

Which indicates that mipadi has commented in @/r/AskReddit@ 61 times (out of his last 100 comments).

To see the comments for a specific subreddit, tack on that subreddit:

bc. $ usaidwat log mipadi AskReddit

All the comments for the given subreddit will be printed.
