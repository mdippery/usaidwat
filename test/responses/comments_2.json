The other editor was a girl named Hallie. I spent an entire semester pronouncing it &amp;quot;hey-lee&amp;quot;. Second semester, the photo editor is talking to me and uses the name &amp;quot;hal-lee&amp;quot;. I correct him, and we get into an argument about the pronunciation of the name, so when she comes in later, I ask her if it&amp;#39;s pronounced &amp;quot;hey-lee&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;hal-lee&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hal-lee,&amp;quot; she says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What?
